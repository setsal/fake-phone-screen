## About

Prank your friends with fake phone operation screens! **(PWA support, easily install it on your phone with fullscreen view)**


## Origin 

This project is inspired by [ShizukuIchi/fake-screen](https://github.com/ShizukuIchi/fake-screen)(cool work!) and my phone updates.

How about building fake phone operation screens (like update, lock.etc) on the cellphone？

So I make this project and build it as PWA for easily installing on the mobile. (also practice💪)
